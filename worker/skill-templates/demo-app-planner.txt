## What I do

- Use most current knowledge to build a product requirements document, PRD, for an educational demo application. 
  - Stores that PRD in a file in markdown format named prd.md
- Builds a list of user stories based on the PRD
  - User stories are saved to stories.json 
  - User story follows the format in examples/stories.json


## When to use me

Use this when you are missing ./prd.md or ./stories.json and a demo app is asked to be built

## What I do

- Refresh your knowledge with the PRD found in prd.md and the User Stories found in stories.json
- There are also changelogs available in the changelogs directory.
- A file called struggles.md exists that keeps track of problems that happened from other builders. 
  - If you run into a struggle create or update this file with the date and feedback on what can be done better.
  - Use this file to help others improve and not run into the same issue you did.
- Choose the next appropriate story in the backlog.
  -  Change the status to "in-progress". 
     -  Only update the status, do not change other values.
-  Ensure you have current best practices on how to build the tasks
  - To get the current date run `bash -c "date"`
  - Always use the latest version of software that you install or setup
-  Create a plan that will fulfill the story and meet the acceptance criteria
-  Create and switch to a new GitHub branch with the name of the story
-  Build the story to meet the acceptance criteria of the story. Only attempt this story.
   -  Add relevant tests using the best practices for testing your software.
-  Log your work in changelogs/<STORY-IDENTIFIER>.md
   -  Include in the changelog how to ensure how each of the accceptance criteria can be tested or demonstrated for review.
-  Once you believe you are complete, change the status to "needs-review".
   -  Use the approve-story skill to get your required approval.
   -  Implement your changes and try to reach approval.
-  Commit the code with a solid description and mention the user story in the title. 
-  Update AGENTS.md (or create it if it doesn't exist)
   -  Remember to update struggles.md with anything specific issues you encountered while building
-  Commit your changes, and merge them into the `main` branch
